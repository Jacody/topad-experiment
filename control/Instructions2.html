        Welcome to our economic decision-making experiment. In this game, you will interact with other people and make decisions that determine your payout.<br><br>

        <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
        <h5>Role Assignment:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>You will be randomly assigned a position from 1 to {{ C.NUM_PLAYERS }}.</li>
            <li>Depending on this position, you can receive a payout.</li>
            <li>The first person is offered {{C.STARTINGVALUE }} dollar, and each subsequent person is offered double the previous amount, up to the {{ C.NUM_PLAYERS }}th person who is offered {{C.ENDVALUE }} dollar.</li>
            <li>Here is a full table with the offered Payouts:</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>1.</th>
      <th>2.</th>
      <th>3.</th>
      <th>4.</th>
      <th>5.</th>
      <th>6.</th>
      <th>7.</th>
      <th>8.</th>
      <th>9.</th>
      <th>10.</th>
       {{ if C.NUM_PLAYERS == 12 }}
      <th>11.</th>
      <th>12.</th>
        {{endif}}

    <tr>
      {{ if C.STARTINGVALUE  == 0.03 }}
      <td>0.03</td>
      <td>0.06</td>
      {{endif}}
      <td>0.12</td>
      <td>0.24</td>
      <td>0.48</td>
      <td>0.96</td>
      <td>1.92</td>
      <td>3.84</td>
      <td>7.68</td>
      <td>15.36</td>
      {{ if C.NUM_PLAYERS == 12 or C.STARTINGVALUE == 0.12 }}
      <td>30.72</td>
      <td>61.44</td>
        {{endif}}
    </tr>
  </table>

 <h5>Round Procedure:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>First, you will learn your position for this round and the amount of money offered to you.</li>
            <li>You can either accept the offered amount of money or "pass it on."</li>
            <li>The first position that accepts the money gets the payout. All others get nothing this round.</li>
            <li>The game is played for {{ C.NUM_PLAYERS }} rounds. Each round, all players are assigned a new position and thus a different payout offer.</li>
        </ul>



<h5>Example:</h5>
        <p>In one round, all players decide to pass the money except for positions 4, 6, and 9. They decide to accept the money. In this case, only position 4 gets the payout because it was the first position to accept the money. The other players will learn that position 4 received the money, and a new round with new positions will begin.</p>
 <h5>Important Notes:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no communication between players during the game.</li>
                <li>The decisions of the players are anonymous, and the other players will only learn at which position the money was first accepted, but not by which player.</li>
                 <li>Please stay for the entire duration of the experiment, even if you have to wait for the other players at times.</li>
            </ul>
     <h5>Objective:</h5>
            <p>The objective of this experiment is to analyze the decisions on when an amount is kept for oneself and when an amount of money is rather passed on to others.</p>
