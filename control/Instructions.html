    Thank you for joining our economic experiment.
    You'll be playing for real money in this game.
    You will be placed in a line where each person gets a money offer.
    The first person will be offered 3 cents.
    Each subsequent person will be offered twice as much money as the one before.
    This continues until the 10th person, who will get $15.36.
    Here's what each person will be offered:

    <br><br>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>1.</th>
      <th>2.</th>
      <th>3.</th>
      <th>4.</th>
      <th>5.</th>
      <th>6.</th>
      <th>7.</th>
      <th>8.</th>
      <th>9.</th>
      <th>10.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0,03</td>
      <td>0,06</td>
      <td>0,12</td>
      <td>0,24</td>
      <td>0,48</td>
      <td>0,96</td>
      <td>1,92</td>
      <td>3,84</td>
      <td>7,68</td>
      <td>15,36</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    <br><br>
    <b>The first person in line who agrees to take the offer will get the money, and no one else will.</b>
    If all players decide to pass the money on, the last player will get the money.
    The game will be played for 10 rounds, so there will be 10 Payouts. The position of each player will be shuffled every round.
    After each round, you'll find out which position took the money first and how much money that person received.
